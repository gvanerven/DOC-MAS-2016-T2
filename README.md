*Multi-Agent System Final Project*<br/>

This project is a Multi-Agent System prototype for Controller Agents which send global informations about transactions to Credit Card Holders Agents. In this version, The Holders Agents must verify their own data and match against the global statistics to recognize if they are misusing the card and then notify the Controller with a "guilty" or "not guilty" message.
